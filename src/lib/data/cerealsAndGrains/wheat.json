  "originAndDomesticationHistory": "Wheat was one of the first domesticated food crops, originating in the Fertile Crescent around 10,000 BCE. Einkorn and emmer wheat were early forms, with bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) emerging later through hybridization. Its cultivation spread throughout the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and eventually the Americas.",
  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Optimal 15-25°C during growing season; can tolerate cooler temperatures, especially winter wheat.",
    "rainfall": "400-1200mm annually, depending on the type and region. Drought-tolerant varieties exist.",
    "altitude": "Can be grown from sea level up to 3000m, but performs best at moderate altitudes."
  },
  "soilPreferences": "Well-drained loamy soils are ideal. Prefers a pH range of 6.0-7.5. Tolerates a range of soil types but not waterlogged conditions.",
  "irrigationAndWaterNeeds": "Primarily rain-fed in many regions, but supplementary irrigation is used in drier areas, especially during critical growth stages like flowering and grain filling.",
  "plantingAndHarvestCycles": "Winter wheat is sown in autumn and harvested in late spring/early summer. Spring wheat is sown in spring and harvested in late summer/early autumn. Combine harvesters are typically used.",
  "pestAndDiseaseManagement": "Common pests include aphids, Hessian fly, and wheat midge. Diseases include rusts (leaf, stem, stripe), powdery mildew, and Fusarium head blight. Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies include resistant varieties, crop rotation, and targeted pesticide application.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "Involves threshing to separate grain from chaff, cleaning, and drying to a moisture content of around 12-14% for safe storage. Stored in silos or bins to protect from pests and moisture.",
  "majorProducingCountriesOrRegions": ["China", "India", "Russia", "United States", "France", "Canada", "Australia", "Ukraine", "Pakistan", "Germany"],
  "marketValueAndGlobalDemand": "Wheat is a globally traded commodity with high demand for human consumption and animal feed. Its price is influenced by global production, weather patterns, and trade policies."
