  "originAndDomesticationHistory": "Chickpeas (Cicer arietinum) were domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, specifically in southeastern Turkey, around 7,500 years ago. Archaeological evidence suggests wild Cicer reticulatum as the progenitor. They spread to the Mediterranean basin, India, and Ethiopia in ancient times. Two main types evolved: the larger-seeded Kabuli type (Mediterranean and Middle East) and the smaller-seeded Desi type (Indian subcontinent and Ethiopia).",
  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Cool-season crop. Optimal temperature for growth is 18-26°C. Tolerates some heat during pod fill but sensitive to frost, especially during flowering.",
    "rainfall": "300-600mm annually. Drought-tolerant, particularly Desi types. Excessive rain during flowering or maturity can cause disease and lodging.",
    "altitude": "Can be grown from sea level up to 2500m in tropical and subtropical regions."
  },
  "soilPreferences": "Prefers well-drained sandy loam to clay loam soils with a pH of 6.0-7.5. Does not tolerate waterlogged conditions or highly acidic soils. Good soil aeration is important.",
  "irrigationAndWaterNeeds": "Often grown rain-fed. Supplemental irrigation may be necessary in dry regions, especially during flowering and pod development, to ensure good yields. Over-irrigation can lead to fungal diseases.",
  "plantingAndHarvestCycles": "Planted in spring in temperate regions or in autumn/winter in subtropical regions. Seeds are sown 3-5 cm deep. Plants are typically harvested when pods are yellow-brown and seeds are hard. Plants can be cut and threshed, or directly combined.",
  "pestAndDiseaseManagement": "Major pests include pod borers (Helicoverpa armigera), aphids, and bruchids (storage pests). Common diseases are Ascochyta blight, Fusarium wilt, and Botrytis grey mold. Integrated pest management includes resistant varieties, crop rotation, seed treatment, and judicious use of pesticides.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "Involves threshing the pods to extract seeds, cleaning the seeds, and drying them to a moisture content of 10-12% for safe storage. Stored in cool, dry conditions to prevent mold and insect infestation.",
  "majorProducingCountriesOrRegions": ["India (largest producer)", "Australia", "Turkey", "Russia", "Myanmar", "Ethiopia", "Pakistan", "United States", "Canada", "Mexico"],
  "marketValueAndGlobalDemand": "Chickpeas are a globally important pulse crop with high demand for human consumption, particularly in South Asia, the Middle East, and Mediterranean countries. Growing demand in Western countries due to interest in plant-based diets and products like hummus. Prices fluctuate based on global production and weather conditions."
