  "healthBenefits": [
    "The fruit's pericarp (rind) is rich in polyphenols, particularly xanthones like mangostin, which possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (though the rind is bitter and not typically consumed fresh).",
    "The edible flesh provides dietary fiber, which supports digestive health.",
    "Contains various vitamins and minerals, contributing to overall nutrition, although generally in modest amounts in the flesh."

      "severity": "Mild to Moderate",
      "details": "Individuals with latex allergies may rarely experience cross-reactivity with mangosteen. Symptoms could include itching, hives, or other allergic reactions. Otherwise, mangosteen is generally well-tolerated."
    }
  ],
  "cultivationProcess": "Mangosteen is an ultra-tropical tree requiring high humidity, consistent rainfall, and warm temperatures (ideally 25\u201335\u00b0C), with no tolerance for temperatures below 4\u00b0C. It prefers deep, well-drained, slightly acidic soil rich in organic matter. Propagation is primarily by seeds, which are apomictic (genetically identical to the mother tree), as vegetative propagation is difficult. Trees are slow-growing, especially in the early years, and require partial shade when young. Full sun is tolerated by mature trees.",
  "growthDuration": "Mangosteen trees are notoriously slow-growing. They typically take 6 to 12 years from seedling to first fruit production, though some may bear earlier under optimal conditions. The fruit itself takes about 5-6 months to mature after flowering.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Due to its specific tropical climate needs, mangosteens are often imported. Opt for fruit shipped by sea rather than air-freighted to reduce carbon emissions.",
    "Support fair-trade certified mangosteens if available, as they are often grown by smallholders in developing countries."
  ],
  "carbonFootprintInfo": "Fresh mangosteens imported to non-tropical countries generally have a high carbon footprint due to the necessity of air freight for their short shelf life and delicate nature. Locally consumed mangosteens in their native regions have a much lower impact. Processed forms (canned, frozen) may vary depending on processing and transportation methods.",
  "staticRecipes": [
    {
      "name": "Fresh Mangosteen Salad",
      "description": "A simple and refreshing salad that highlights the unique sweet-tart flavor of fresh mangosteens, often paired with other tropical fruits.",
      "ingredients": [
        "8-10 fresh mangosteens",
        "1 cup diced ripe mango",
        "1 cup diced fresh pineapple",
        "1 tablespoon fresh lime juice (optional)",
        "1 teaspoon honey or agave nectar (optional, if fruits are not very sweet)",
        "A few fresh mint leaves, chiffonade (optional, for garnish)"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Prepare the mangosteens: Using a sharp knife, carefully score the rind around the middle of each mangosteen, being cautious not to cut through to the flesh.",
        "Gently twist the scored rind to separate the two halves. Remove the top half of the rind.",
        "Carefully scoop out the white, fleshy segments from the rind. The larger segments may contain a seed; these can be removed if desired, though smaller seeds are often soft enough to be eaten.",
        "In a medium bowl, combine the fresh mangosteen segments, diced mango, and diced pineapple.",
        "If using, drizzle the lime juice and honey (or agave nectar) over the fruit mixture. Toss gently to combine.",
        "Serve immediately, or chill for about 15-30 minutes to enhance the refreshing quality.",
        "Garnish with fresh mint leaves before serving, if desired."
