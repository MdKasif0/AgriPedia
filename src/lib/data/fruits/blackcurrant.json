      "name": "Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS)",
      "severity": "Mild",
      "details": "Rare, but individuals with birch pollen allergies might experience OAS. Symptoms are usually mild and include itching or swelling of the mouth, lips, tongue, and throat after consuming raw blackcurrants."
    }
  ],
  "cultivationProcess": "Blackcurrants are hardy deciduous shrubs that prefer cool, moist climates and well-drained, fertile soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH. They are typically propagated from cuttings or purchased as young bushes. Planting is best done in autumn or winter. Bushes require regular pruning to remove old, unproductive wood and encourage new growth, as fruit is primarily borne on one-year-old shoots. They need consistent watering, especially during fruit development, and benefit from mulching and appropriate fertilization.",
  "growthDuration": "Bushes usually start producing a small crop 1-2 years after planting, with significant yields typically from year 3 or 4. Fruits ripen in mid-summer, about 90-110 days after flowering, depending on the cultivar and climate.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Choose locally grown blackcurrants when in season to minimize food miles and support local agriculture.",
    "Preserve excess blackcurrants by freezing, canning, or making jams/jellies to reduce food waste and enjoy them year-round."
  ],
  "carbonFootprintInfo": "The carbon footprint of fresh blackcurrants is relatively low when sourced locally and in season. However, processing (e.g., for juices, concentrates) and long-distance transportation (especially air freight for fresh berries out of season) can significantly increase their environmental impact.",

    {
      "name": "Simple Blackcurrant Jam",
      "description": "A classic, easy-to-make jam that captures the deliciously tart and intense flavor of fresh blackcurrants. Perfect on toast, scones, or with yogurt.",
      "ingredients": [
        "500g fresh blackcurrants, rinsed and stems removed",
        "500g granulated sugar",
        "Juice of 1/2 lemon (optional, aids setting and brightens flavor)",
        "25ml water (if not using lemon juice)"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Combine the blackcurrants and water (or lemon juice) in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan.",
        "Simmer gently over medium-low heat for 15-20 minutes, or until the blackcurrant skins are very soft and have started to burst. Stir occasionally.",
        "Add the sugar to the saucepan. Stir continuously over low heat until the sugar has completely dissolved. Do not let the mixture boil at this stage.",
        "Once the sugar is dissolved, increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a rolling boil (a boil that continues even when you stir it).",
        "Boil rapidly for 10-15 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent the jam from sticking to the bottom of the pan.",
        "Test for setting point: Place a small spoonful of jam onto a chilled saucer, let it cool for 30 seconds, then push it with your finger. If it wrinkles, it's set. Alternatively, use a jam thermometer – setting point is 105°C (221°F).",
        "Once setting point is reached, remove the saucepan from the heat. Skim off any foam/scum from the surface using a slotted spoon.",
        "Let the jam sit for about 10-15 minutes to cool slightly; this helps prevent the fruit from floating in the jars.",
        "Carefully pour the hot jam into warm, sterilized jars, leaving about 1cm headspace. Seal the jars tightly while hot.",
        "Allow the jars to cool completely. Label and store in a cool, dark, dry place. Refrigerate after opening."
