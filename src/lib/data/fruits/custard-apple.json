  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Climate: Tropical and subtropical, requires warm temperatures and is sensitive to frost.\n2. Soil: Well-drained, fertile soil with good organic matter. Tolerates a range of soil types but prefers pH 6.0-7.5.\n3. Propagation: Primarily by seeds, which germinate readily. Grafting is used for superior varieties.\n4. Planting: Plant in full sun. Trees can grow quite large.\n5. Watering: Regular watering is needed, especially for young trees and during dry periods. Avoid waterlogging.\n6. Fertilizing: Apply balanced fertilizer during growth periods.\n7. Pollination: May require hand pollination in some areas for good fruit set due to dichogamy (male and female parts mature at different times).\n8. Harvesting: Fruits are harvested when they are mature (skin turns lighter green, segments slightly separate) but still firm. They ripen quickly off the tree.",
  "growthDuration": "Seedling trees may bear fruit in 3-5 years. Fruit ripens 3-4 months after flowering.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Store unripe custard apples at room temperature until they yield to gentle pressure. Ripe fruit can be refrigerated for 1-2 days.",
    "The fruit is typically broken open, and the fleshy segments are eaten, spitting out the seeds.",
    "Compost the skin and discarded seeds."
