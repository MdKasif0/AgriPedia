  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Climate: Tropical and subtropical, thrives in warm, humid conditions. Drought tolerant once established but needs protection from frost.\n2. Soil: Well-drained, sandy loam or lateritic soils are ideal. Tolerates a range of soil types.\n3. Propagation: Usually by seeds, grafting, or air layering. Seeds may take a long time to fruit and may not be true to type.\n4. Planting: Plant in full sun, providing ample space for growth.\n5. Watering: Young trees require regular watering. Mature trees are drought-resistant but benefit from irrigation during dry spells, especially during fruit development.\n6. Fertilizing: Apply balanced fertilizer during active growth, typically twice a year.\n7. Harvesting: Fruits are picked when they are fully mature but still firm. Maturity is judged by a dull brown color and sometimes a slight give. They ripen off the tree.",
  "growthDuration": "Seedling trees can take 5-8 years to bear fruit. Grafted trees may start in 2-4 years.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Store unripe sapotas at room temperature until they soften. Ripe ones can be refrigerated for a few days.",
    "Sapota seeds are not edible and should be discarded.",
