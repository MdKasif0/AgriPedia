  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Planting: Plant bare-root trees in early spring or container-grown trees anytime soil is workable. Choose a sunny location with good air circulation.\n2. Soil: Apples prefer well-drained, loamy soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0). Amend soil with compost before planting.\n3. Watering: Water young trees regularly, especially during dry periods (1-2 inches per week). Mature trees are more drought-tolerant but benefit from deep watering during prolonged drought.\n4. Fertilizing: Apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring before new growth begins. Avoid over-fertilizing.\n5. Pruning: Prune annually during dormancy (late winter/early spring) to maintain shape and encourage fruit production.\n6. Pollination: Most apple varieties require cross-pollination. Ensure a suitable pollinator is nearby.",
  "growthDuration": "Typically 3-5 years for a young tree to bear its first significant fruit crop. Fruits mature in 100-200 days from bloom.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Store in the fridge to prolong freshness, not in a fruit bowl.",
    "Compost apple cores or use them to make apple cider vinegar.",
    "Buy local apples in season to reduce food miles."
