  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Climate: Temperate climates with sufficient winter chill hours for bud break, followed by warm summers for fruit ripening. Protect from late spring frosts.\n2. Soil: Well-drained, sandy loam soil with good organic content. pH 6.0-7.0.\n3. Propagation: Usually grafted onto rootstock to ensure variety characteristics and disease resistance.\n4. Planting: Plant bare-root trees in late winter or early spring. Container-grown trees can be planted more flexibly. Full sun is essential.\n5. Watering: Regular, deep watering, especially during fruit development and dry spells. Avoid waterlogged soil.\n6. Fertilizing: Apply balanced fertilizer in early spring and possibly again in early summer.\n7. Pruning: Prune annually during dormancy to maintain an open center or vase shape, remove dead/diseased wood, and encourage fruit production on one-year-old wood.\n8. Thinning: Thin young fruits to 6-8 inches apart to ensure larger, higher-quality mature fruits.\n9. Harvesting: Peaches are harvested when they reach full color (yellow/red, depending on variety), soften slightly, and have a sweet aroma. They are typically picked by hand.",
  "growthDuration": "Grafted trees can start bearing fruit in 2-4 years. Fruits mature 3-5 months after flowering.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Store unripe peaches at room temperature. Once ripe, they can be refrigerated for a few days.",
    "Peaches bruise easily; handle with care.",
    "Freeze sliced peaches for later use in smoothies, pies, or cobblers.",
    "Compost peach pits."

  "carbonFootprintInfo": "Moderate. Locally grown peaches in season have a lower footprint (0.4-0.8 kg CO2e/kg). Transport significantly increases this.",
