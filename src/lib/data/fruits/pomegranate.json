  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Climate: Pomegranates prefer climates with hot, dry summers and cool winters. They are relatively drought-tolerant once established.\n2. Soil: Adaptable to various soils but thrive in well-drained, deep loamy soil. Slightly acidic to neutral pH.\n3. Propagation: Can be grown from seeds, cuttings, or suckers. Plant in full sun.\n4. Watering: Water deeply but infrequently. Allow soil to dry out somewhat between waterings.\n5. Fertilizing: Light fertilization in spring. Avoid over-fertilizing, which can reduce fruit yield.\n6. Pruning: Prune to shape, remove suckers, and thin out dense growth to improve air circulation and light penetration.\n7. Harvesting: Fruits are ready when they develop full color (typically deep red) and make a metallic sound when tapped. They do not ripen further after picking.",
  "growthDuration": "Trees may start bearing fruit in 2-3 years, with good production by 5-6 years.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Store pomegranates at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for several weeks.",

        "Lightly score the rind vertically from top to bottom in 4-6 sections, without cutting too deep into the fruit.",
        "Submerge the pomegranate in a large bowl of water. Gently break apart the sections under water. The arils will sink to the bottom, and the white membrane will float.",
        "Scoop out the floating membrane and discard. Drain the water and collect the arils.",
        "Alternatively, hold a section over a bowl, cut-side down, and firmly tap the rind with a wooden spoon. The arils should fall out easily."
