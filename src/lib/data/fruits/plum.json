Slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0).\n3. Propagation: Usually by grafting onto rootstock.\n4. Planting: Plant in full sun. Allow adequate space for tree growth.\n5. Watering: Regular watering, especially during dry periods and fruit development.\n6. Fertilizing: Apply balanced fertilizer in early spring.\n7. Pruning: Prune to maintain shape, remove dead/diseased wood, and encourage fruit production.\n8. Thinning: Thin fruits to prevent branch breakage and ensure larger fruit size.",
