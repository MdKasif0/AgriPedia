Soil: Grows in a wide variety of soils but prefers deep, well-drained loamy soil.\n3. Propagation: Primarily by seeds. Grafting can be used for superior types.\n4. Planting: Plant in full sun. Trees can grow very large.\n5. Watering: Young trees need regular watering. Mature trees are very drought-tolerant.\n6. Harvesting: Pods are harvested when they turn brown and brittle. The pulp is extracted from the pods.",
  "growthDuration": "Seedling trees may take 6-12 years to bear fruit. Fruits ripen in late winter to spring.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Tamarind pulp is often sold as a paste or block, which has a long shelf life.",

        "Break the tamarind block into smaller pieces and place it in a heatproof bowl.",
        "Pour hot (not boiling) water over the tamarind pieces, just enough to cover them. Let it soak for 20-30 minutes, or until the pulp softens.",
        "Once softened, use your fingers (clean hands!) or a sturdy spoon to mash the pulp thoroughly in the water. Squeeze the pulp to release its essence into the water. The water will turn brown and thick.",
        "Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into another bowl. Press down firmly on the solids in the sieve with the back of a spoon to extract as much thick pulp as possible.",
        "Discard the seeds and fibrous material left in the sieve.",
        "The resulting thick liquid is tamarind paste/pulp. It can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a few weeks or frozen for longer storage."
