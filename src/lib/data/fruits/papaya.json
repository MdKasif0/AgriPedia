  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Climate: Papayas are tropical plants needing warm weather, full sun, and protection from frost.\n2. Soil: Well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter. pH 6.0-6.5.\n3. Propagation: Grown from seeds. Plant seeds in pots or directly in the ground.\n4. Watering: Requires regular watering, especially during dry periods, but dislikes waterlogged soil.\n5. Fertilizing: Feed regularly with a balanced fertilizer.\n6. Sexing Plants: Papaya plants can be male, female, or hermaphrodite. Hermaphrodite plants are preferred for fruit production. Usually, multiple seedlings are planted and thinned later.\n7. Harvesting: Fruits are harvested when they start showing yellow/orange color and yield slightly to pressure.",
  "growthDuration": "Can bear fruit within 6-12 months from seed under ideal conditions.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
