  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Climate: Subtropical to tropical. Different varieties have different cold tolerances.\n2. Soil: Well-drained, aerated soil with a pH of 6.0-7.0. Avoid heavy clay soils.\n3. Propagation: Usually by grafting onto rootstock. Growing from seed is possible but fruit quality is unpredictable and takes longer.\n4. Planting: Plant in full sun, protected from strong winds.\n5. Watering: Regular, deep watering, especially for young trees and during fruit development. Allow soil to dry slightly between waterings.\n6. Fertilizing: Apply balanced citrus/avocado fertilizer several times a year.\n7. Harvesting: Avocados do not ripen on the tree. They are harvested when mature (size and oil content) and then ripen at room temperature. Maturity signs vary by variety.",
  "growthDuration": "Grafted trees can start bearing fruit in 3-5 years. Fruits take 6-18 months to mature on the tree, depending on variety.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Store unripe avocados at room temperature; ripened ones in the refrigerator.",
    "To speed up ripening, place in a paper bag with an apple or banana.",
    "Use lemon/lime juice on cut avocado to prevent browning.",
    "Consider water usage in avocado production; choose sources with sustainable water practices if possible."
