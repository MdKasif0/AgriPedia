  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Climate: Temperate to subtropical, thrives in areas with long, hot summers and mild winters. Some varieties are more cold-hardy.\n2. Soil: Adaptable to various soils but prefers well-drained, fertile loam. Tolerates slightly alkaline conditions.\n3. Propagation: Easily propagated from cuttings. Can also be grown from seeds, but quality may vary.\n4. Planting: Plant in full sun. Can be grown in containers, especially in colder regions.\n5. Watering: Young trees require regular watering. Mature trees are relatively drought-tolerant but produce better fruit with consistent moisture, especially during fruit development.\n6. Fertilizing: Generally light feeders. A balanced fertilizer in spring may be beneficial.\n7. Pruning: Prune during dormancy to shape the tree, remove dead wood, and encourage fruit production (figs often fruit on new and old wood, depending on variety).\n8. Harvesting: Figs are harvested when they are soft to the touch, droop slightly on the stem, and have fully developed color. They do not ripen much after picking.",
  "growthDuration": "Trees from cuttings can start bearing fruit in 1-3 years. Figs typically have two crops per year in suitable climates (breba crop on old wood, main crop on new wood).",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Fresh figs are highly perishable; store in the refrigerator and consume within a few days.",
    "Dried figs have a long shelf life and are a good way to preserve the fruit.",
    "Enjoy fresh figs with their skin; wash thoroughly.",
    "Compost any unused parts."

  "carbonFootprintInfo": "Moderate. Fresh figs can have a higher footprint if air-freighted due to perishability (0.8-2.0 kg CO2e/kg). Dried figs generally have a lower footprint.",
