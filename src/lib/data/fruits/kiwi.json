  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Climate: Temperate climates with sufficient winter chill. Requires a long growing season.\n2. Soil: Well-drained, fertile, slightly acidic soil (pH 5.5-6.5) rich in organic matter.\n3. Propagation: Seeds, cuttings, or grafting. Most commercial kiwis are dioecious (separate male and female plants), requiring both for fruit production.\n4. Planting: Plant in full sun on a sturdy trellis or pergola for the vigorous vines.\n5. Watering: Requires consistent moisture, especially during the growing season and fruit development.\n6. Fertilizing: Apply balanced fertilizer regularly during the growing season.\n7. Pruning: Extensive pruning is necessary during dormancy and summer to manage growth and encourage fruiting.\n8. Harvesting: Fruits are harvested when firm and mature. They ripen off the vine.",
  "growthDuration": "Vines typically start bearing fruit in 3-5 years. Fruit matures in late autumn.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Store kiwis at room temperature to ripen, then refrigerate for longer storage.",
    "Kiwis can be eaten by cutting in half and scooping out the flesh, or by peeling and slicing.",
    "The skin is edible for some varieties if well-washed (and fuzz removed for green kiwis)."
