Soil: Adaptable to various soils, including poor or alkaline soils, but prefers well-drained sandy loam.\n3. Propagation: Usually by seeds. Budding and grafting are also practiced.\n4. Planting: Plant in full sun.\n5. Watering: Young plants need regular watering. Mature trees are extremely drought-tolerant.\n6. Fertilizing: Generally does not require much fertilizer. Organic manure is beneficial.\n7. Harvesting: Fruits are harvested when they change from greenish-gray to yellowish. The hard shell needs to be cracked open.",
  "growthDuration": "Seedling trees may take 6-8 years to bear fruit. Fruits mature in summer.",
