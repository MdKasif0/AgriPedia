  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Propagation: Bananas are typically grown from \"pups\" or suckers.\n2. Site Selection: Choose a location with full sun, protection from strong winds, and excellent drainage.\n3. Soil: Bananas thrive in rich, fertile, well-drained soil, high in organic matter. Ideal pH is 5.5-6.5.\n4. Planting: Plant pups ensuring the corm is well-covered.\n5. Watering: Bananas are heavy feeders and require consistent moisture.\n6. Fertilizing: Apply a balanced fertilizer rich in potassium regularly.\n7. De-suckering: Remove excess suckers, leaving only one or two strong ones.\n8. Harvesting: Fruit bunch is harvested when bananas are plump but still green.",
  "growthDuration": "Approximately 9-12 months from planting a pup to harvesting the first bunch of bananas.",
