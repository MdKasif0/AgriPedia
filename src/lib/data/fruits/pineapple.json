  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Propagation: Commonly grown from the crown (top) of a mature pineapple fruit, or from slips or suckers.\n2. Climate: Tropical plant, needs warm temperatures, high humidity, and full sun.\n3. Soil: Well-drained, acidic (pH 4.5-6.5), sandy loam soil rich in organic matter.\n4. Planting: Plant the crown after allowing the cut base to dry for a few days. Can be grown in pots or ground.\n5. Watering: Requires regular watering but dislikes waterlogged conditions.\n6. Fertilizing: Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer every few months during the growing season.\n7. Fruiting: Takes a long time to fruit, often 18-24 months or more from planting a crown.\n8. Harvesting: Fruit is ready when it develops a golden-yellow color at the base and has a strong sweet fragrance.",
