Soil: Prefers well-drained, sandy loam soil rich in organic matter, pH 6.0-6.8.\n3. Planting: Sow seeds directly after the last frost or start indoors 3-4 weeks prior.\n4. Spacing: Vines need space; plant in hills or rows with adequate spacing.\n5. Watering: Consistent watering is needed, especially during fruit development. Avoid wetting foliage if possible.\n6. Fertilizing: Benefit from balanced fertilizer, with increased potassium during fruiting.\n7. Harvesting: Ripeness indicated by a sweet aroma, rind changing color (often to beige or yellow under the netting), and the melon easily detaching from the vine ('full slip').",
