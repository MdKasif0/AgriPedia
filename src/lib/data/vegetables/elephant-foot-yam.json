  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Tropical and subtropical warm, humid climate. Optimal 25-35°C. Requires a long growing season. Sensitive to frost.",
    "rainfall": "Prefers well-distributed rainfall (1000-1500 mm annually) or irrigation. Cannot tolerate waterlogging for extended periods, despite being a wetland plant in some native habitats.",
    "altitude": "Grows well from sea level up to 800m."
  },
  "soilPreferences": "Rich, well-drained, fertile loamy or alluvial soils with high organic matter content. Prefers slightly acidic to neutral pH (5.5-7.0).",
  "irrigationWaterNeeds": "Requires consistent and ample moisture throughout the growing period, especially during corm development. Regular irrigation is necessary in areas with insufficient rainfall. Good drainage is crucial to prevent corm rot.",
  "plantingHarvestCycles": "Propagated from corm pieces (setts) or small cormels, planted at the beginning of the rainy season. Matures in 8-10 months. Single large corm per plant. Leaves yellow and die back indicating maturity. Harvested manually by digging up the corms.",
  "pestDiseaseManagement": "Pests: Aphids, mealybugs, scale insects, nematodes, yam beetles. Diseases: Corm rot (due to Fusarium, Pythium, Sclerotium), mosaic virus, leaf blight. Management includes using healthy planting material, crop rotation, proper field sanitation, good drainage, and chemical control if necessary.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "Corms are harvested carefully to avoid bruising. Curing (drying the surface) for a few days can improve storage life. Store in cool, dry, well-ventilated conditions (10-15°C) for several months. Handle with care as raw corms contain calcium oxalate crystals which can irritate skin; proper cooking neutralizes this.",
