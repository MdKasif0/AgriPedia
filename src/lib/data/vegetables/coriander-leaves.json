  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Planting: Cool-season herb, prone to bolting (flowering) in hot weather. Sow seeds directly in spring or fall.\n2. Soil: Well-drained, fertile soil. pH 6.0-7.0. Full sun to partial shade.\n3. Spacing: Sow seeds 1/4-1/2 inch deep. Thin seedlings if needed.\n4. Watering: Keep soil consistently moist, especially during germination and active growth.\n5. Harvesting: Harvest outer leaves when plants are 4-6 inches tall. Pinching back tips encourages bushier growth. Seeds (coriander spice) are harvested when plant flowers and seed heads turn brown.",

  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Cool season herb for leaf (cilantro) production, optimal 15-22°C. Tolerates warmer temperatures for seed (coriander) production but bolts quickly. Sensitive to frost.",
    "rainfall": "Prefers consistent moisture, around 400-600 mm during growing season or regular irrigation. Well-drained soil is crucial to prevent root rot.",
    "altitude": "Can be grown from sea level to moderate altitudes, typically up to 2000m."
  },
  "soilPreferences": "Well-drained, fertile, loamy soil rich in organic matter. Prefers slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.5).",
  "irrigationWaterNeeds": "Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during germination and active leaf growth. Water stress can lead to premature bolting (flowering). Drip irrigation or light overhead watering is suitable.",
  "plantingHarvestCycles": "Propagated by seeds. For cilantro (leaves): sow seeds directly in succession every 2-3 weeks from early spring to early autumn. Harvest outer leaves once plants are 4-6 inches tall. For coriander (seeds): plant in spring. Seeds mature when plants turn brown and seed heads are dry, typically 90-120 days after sowing. Harvest by cutting entire plants/seed heads.",
  "pestDiseaseManagement": "Pests: Aphids, armyworms, cutworms, leafhoppers. Diseases: Powdery mildew, bacterial leaf spot, Fusarium wilt, stem gall. Management includes crop rotation, good air circulation, avoiding overhead watering in humid conditions, using disease-free seeds, and organic pest controls.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "Cilantro leaves: Highly perishable. Harvest early in the day. Store in the refrigerator with stems in water, covered loosely, or wrapped in a damp paper towel for a few days. Coriander seeds: Harvest seed heads when dry, complete drying on trays or by hanging. Thresh to separate seeds, then clean and store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.",
