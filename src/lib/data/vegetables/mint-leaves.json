  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Planting: Easy to grow. Can be started from seeds, cuttings, or root divisions. Best to grow in pots as it can be invasive in garden beds.\n2. Soil: Well-drained, moist, fertile soil. pH 6.0-7.0.\n3. Location: Full sun to partial shade.\n4. Watering: Keep soil consistently moist, especially in hot weather.\n5. Harvesting: Pick leaves as needed. Regular harvesting encourages bushier growth. Pinch off flower buds to prolong leaf production.",

  "plantingHarvestCycles": "Propagated by seeds (slower), stem cuttings, or division of runners (most common and easiest). Plant in spring or autumn. Perennial plant that spreads vigorously. Harvest leaves and young stems as needed throughout the growing season. Regular harvesting encourages bushier growth. Cut before flowering for best leaf flavor.",
  "pestDiseaseManagement": "Pests: Aphids, spider mites, flea beetles, cutworms, mint loopers. Diseases: Rust (major fungal disease for some mints), powdery mildew, Verticillium wilt, mint anthracnose. Management includes selecting resistant varieties, ensuring good air circulation, avoiding overhead watering, removing infected plants, and using organic controls like neem oil or insecticidal soap.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "Fresh mint is best used soon after harvest. Store sprigs with stems in water at room temperature for a few days, or wrapped in a damp paper towel in the refrigerator for up to a week.
