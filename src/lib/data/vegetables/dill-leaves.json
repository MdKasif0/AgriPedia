  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Planting: Sow seeds directly in the garden in spring after the last frost. Dill does not transplant well.\n2. Soil: Well-drained, fertile soil. pH 5.5-6.5. Full sun.\n3. Spacing: Sow seeds shallowly. Thin seedlings to 6-12 inches apart.\n4. Watering: Water regularly, especially during dry periods.\n5. Harvesting: Harvest leaves (dill weed) anytime after plants are established (6-8 inches tall). Seeds (dill seed spice) are harvested when seed heads turn brown and dry.",
  "growthDuration": "Leaves ready for harvest in 6-8 weeks from sowing.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Store fresh dill sprigs with stems in a glass of water in the refrigerator, covered loosely with a plastic bag, or wrap in a damp paper towel.",
    "Dill leaves can be finely chopped and frozen in ice cube trays with water or oil.",
    "Dried dill weed loses some flavor but is still useful. Dill seeds have a stronger, different flavor profile."
