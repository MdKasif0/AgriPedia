  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Soil Preparation: Carrots need loose, well-drained, sandy loam or loamy soil, free of stones. Ideal pH 6.0-6.8.\n2. Sowing Seeds: Sow seeds directly into the garden bed 1/4 to 1/2 inch deep in early spring or late summer for a fall crop.\n3. Watering: Keep the soil consistently moist during germination (which can take 1-3 weeks). Water regularly, about 1 inch per week.\n4. Thinning: Thin seedlings to 2-3 inches apart when they are a few inches tall to allow proper root development.\n5. Weeding: Keep the area weed-free, as carrots don't compete well. Mulch can help suppress weeds and retain moisture.\n6. Harvesting: Ready in 60-80 days, depending on variety. Harvest when roots reach desired size and color. Loosen soil gently before pulling.",
  "growthDuration": "Generally 60-80 days from sowing seeds to harvest.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
      "Store carrots in the crisper drawer of the refrigerator. Remove greens (if attached) to prevent moisture loss from the roots.",
      "Use carrot tops in pesto, stocks, or salads – they are edible and nutritious.",
      "Choose 'ugly' or misshapen carrots when available to help reduce food waste."
