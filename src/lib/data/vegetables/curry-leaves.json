  "cultivationProcess": "Curry leaf trees are tropical to subtropical small trees or shrubs. They can be propagated from seeds (though germination can be slow), root suckers, or stem cuttings. They thrive in well-drained soil, prefer full sun to partial shade, and require regular watering, especially when young. Once established, they are relatively hardy. Leaves can be harvested as needed throughout the year.",
  "growthDuration": "Plants grown from seeds may take 1-2 years to become established enough for regular harvesting. Vegetative propagation can lead to faster establishment. Mature plants provide a continuous supply of leaves.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Growing a curry leaf plant in a pot or garden (in suitable climates) is very sustainable, providing fresh leaves as needed and eliminating packaging and transport.",
    "Fresh leaves offer the best flavor; they can also be air-dried or frozen for longer storage, reducing waste."
  ],
  "carbonFootprintInfo": "Fresh curry leaves picked from a home garden or sourced locally have a negligible carbon footprint. Commercially packaged leaves, especially those transported long distances (sometimes internationally) or requiring refrigeration, will have a higher environmental impact.",
  "staticRecipes": [
    {
      "name": "Basic South Indian Tempering (Tadka/Thaalithal)",
      "description": "A fundamental flavoring technique in South Indian cooking where spices, including fresh curry leaves, are briefly fried in oil or ghee to release their aromas before being added to a dish like dal, sambar, chutney, or vegetable stir-fries.",
      "ingredients": [
        "1 tablespoon cooking oil (e.g., coconut oil, sesame oil, or vegetable oil) or ghee",
        "1/2 teaspoon black mustard seeds (rai)",
        "1/2 teaspoon urad dal (split black gram lentils, optional)",
        "1-2 dried red chilies, broken into pieces (optional, for heat)",
        "1 sprig (about 10-15) fresh curry leaves",
        "A pinch of asafoetida (hing) (optional)"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Ensure all ingredients are prepped and within reach, as tempering is a quick process.",
        "Heat the oil or ghee in a small pan (often a special tadka pan) over medium-high heat until it's hot but not smoking.",
        "Add the black mustard seeds to the hot oil. Wait for them to splutter and pop, which usually takes a few seconds. Be cautious as they can jump out of the pan.",
        "If using, add the urad dal and dried red chilies next. Fry for a few seconds, stirring, until the dal turns a light golden brown. Do not let it burn.",
        "Carefully add the fresh curry leaves to the pan (they may spatter if there's any moisture on them). Add the asafoetida if using.",
        "Stir and fry for another 5-10 seconds until the curry leaves become crisp and very aromatic.",
        "Immediately pour the entire tempering mixture (the oil along with all the spices) over your prepared dish (e.g., dal, sambar, chutney, upma, poha, or a vegetable sabzi).",
        "Often, the dish is then covered for a minute to allow the flavors to infuse before stirring it in or serving."

  "uses": [
    "Culinary herb (fresh or dried leaves used to flavor curries, soups, stews, rice dishes, snacks, tempering/tadka)",
    "Traditional medicine (leaves, bark, roots used for digestive issues, diabetes management, skin ailments, as a tonic)",
    "Essential oil (limited use, for fragrance and traditional remedies)",
    "Ornamental plant"
  ],
  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Tropical and subtropical. Optimal 20-30°C. Tolerates heat well but is sensitive to frost. Prefers full sun to light shade.",
    "rainfall": "Prefers moderate rainfall (1000-1500 mm annually), well-distributed. Can tolerate some drought once established but benefits from moisture for good leaf production.",
    "altitude": "Grows well from sea level up to 1500m."
  },
  "soilPreferences": "Well-drained, fertile loamy or sandy loam soils, rich in organic matter. pH 5.5-7.5. Avoids heavy clay or waterlogged conditions.",
  "irrigationWaterNeeds": "Young plants require regular watering. Mature plants are relatively drought-tolerant but benefit from irrigation during prolonged dry spells to maintain lush foliage. Good drainage is essential.",
  "plantingHarvestCycles": "Propagated by seeds (sown fresh), root suckers, or stem cuttings. Seedlings are slow to establish. Plants can be harvested for leaves throughout the year once established (typically after 1-2 years). Harvest sprigs or individual leaves as needed. Regular light harvesting encourages bushier growth.",
  "pestDiseaseManagement": "Pests: Scale insects, mealybugs, aphids, psyllids. Diseases: Fungal leaf spot, sooty mold (associated with insect honeydew), root rot (in poorly drained soils). Generally quite hardy. Management includes good air circulation, avoiding overwatering, and organic pest controls like neem oil if necessary.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "Fresh leaves are highly aromatic and best used quickly. Can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 weeks (e.g., wrapped in paper towel in a plastic bag). Leaves can be air-dried or sun-dried for longer storage, though some aroma is lost. Freezing fresh leaves is also an option.",
  "majorProducingCountries": [
    "India",
    "Sri Lanka",

    "Cultivated in home gardens and on a small commercial scale in many tropical regions globally."
  ],
  "marketValueGlobalDemand": "High demand in South Asian and Southeast Asian cuisines worldwide. Fresh leaves are preferred and traded significantly to diaspora markets. Dried leaves and powder also have a market. Essential for authentic flavor in many traditional dishes."
