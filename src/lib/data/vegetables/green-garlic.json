  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Cool season crop, tolerant of cold. Optimal growth 12-24°C. Can withstand light frosts. Same as mature garlic but harvested earlier.",
    "rainfall": "Prefers consistent moisture. About 25 mm per week or equivalent irrigation. Good drainage is important.",
    "altitude": "Adaptable, similar to mature garlic, grown at various altitudes."

  "soilPreferences": "Well-drained, fertile loamy soils rich in organic matter. pH 6.0-7.0 (slightly acidic to neutral). Avoids heavy clay or waterlogged soils.",
  "irrigationWaterNeeds": "Requires consistent soil moisture throughout its shorter growing period. Water deeply when soil surface begins to dry. Drip irrigation or soaker hoses are effective.",
  "plantingHarvestCycles": "Propagated from garlic cloves planted in autumn (for overwintering and early spring harvest) or early spring. Harvested when plants are young and tender, typically 2-4 months after planting, before bulbs fully form. Pulled or cut at ground level.",
  "pestDiseaseManagement": "Pests: Onion thrips, aphids. Diseases: Similar to mature garlic but less susceptible due to shorter growing period; includes white rot, downy mildew, rust. Crop rotation, good drainage, and sanitation are important. Less prone to issues than mature garlic that stays in ground longer.",
