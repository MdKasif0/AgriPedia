Soil: Well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter. pH 5.5-6.8. Full sun required.\n3. Spacing: Space plants 18-24 inches apart.\n4. Watering: Consistent watering, especially during flowering and fruiting.\n5. Staking: Taller varieties may need staking for support as fruits develop.\n6. Harvesting: Harvest when fruits are glossy, firm, and full-sized for the variety, but before seeds harden. Cut from the plant with about an inch of stem attached.",
