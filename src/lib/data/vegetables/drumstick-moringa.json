  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Planting: Fast-growing tree. Can be grown from seeds or cuttings.\n2. Soil: Well-drained sandy or loamy soil. Tolerates poor soils. pH 6.3-7.0.\n3. Climate: Tropical and subtropical. Drought-resistant. Prefers full sun.\n4. Watering: Water young plants regularly. Mature trees are drought-tolerant but produce better with occasional deep watering.\n5. Pruning: Prune regularly to encourage branching and keep the tree at a manageable height for harvesting leaves and pods.\n6. Harvesting: Pods are harvested when young and tender (about pencil thickness). Leaves can be harvested at any time once tree is established.",
  "growthDuration": "Can start producing pods within 6-12 months in ideal conditions.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "All parts of the moringa tree (leaves, pods, flowers, seeds) are utilized in some way.",
