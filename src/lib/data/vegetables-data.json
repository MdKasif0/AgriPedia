Watering: Keep the soil consistently moist during germination (which can take 1-3 weeks). Water regularly, about 1 inch per week.\n4. Thinning: Thin seedlings to 2-3 inches apart when they are a few inches tall to allow proper root development.\n5. Weeding: Keep the area weed-free, as carrots don't compete well. Mulch can help suppress weeds and retain moisture.\n6. Harvesting: Ready in 60-80 days, depending on variety. Harvest when roots reach desired size and color. Loosen soil gently before pulling.",
