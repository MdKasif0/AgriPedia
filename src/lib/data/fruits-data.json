Watering: Water young trees regularly, especially during dry periods (1-2 inches per week). Mature trees are more drought-tolerant but benefit from deep watering during prolonged drought.\n4. Fertilizing: Apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring before new growth begins. Avoid over-fertilizing.\n5. Pruning: Prune annually during dormancy (late winter/early spring) to maintain shape and encourage fruit production.\n6. Pollination: Most apple varieties require cross-pollination.
