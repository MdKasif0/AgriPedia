Choose a sunny location with good air circulation.\n2. Soil: Apples prefer well-drained, loamy soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0). Amend soil with compost before planting.\n3. Watering: Water young trees regularly, especially during dry periods (1-2 inches per week). Mature trees are more drought-tolerant but benefit from deep watering during prolonged drought.\n4. Fertilizing: Apply a balanced fertilizer in early spring before new growth begins. Avoid over-fertilizing.\n5. Pruning: Prune annually during dormancy (late winter/early spring) to maintain shape and encourage fruit production.\n6. Pollination: Most apple varieties require cross-pollination. Ensure a suitable pollinator is nearby.",
